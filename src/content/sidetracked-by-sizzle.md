# Not Sidetracked by Sizzle

## What It Means

"Sidetracked by Sizzle" describes those moments when tech novelties and flashy features lure us away from practical solutions. It's about being captivated by a glossy facade at the expense of substance—like a smart toaster with a built-in weather forecast that looks impressive but adds little real value.

I often add "Not Sidetracked by Sizzle" in my online profiles as a commitment to valuing essence over enticement, focusing on tangible business benefits to deliver effective solutions.

## Recognizing the Warning Signs

Several indicators reveal when you've been sidetracked:

- **Perception Over Impact**: Focusing on a feature's cutting-edge appeal without understanding how it solves business problems
- **Resource Misallocation**: Investing significant time and resources into features with unclear business benefits
- **Impression Over Solution**: Showcasing flashy dashboards while core functionality issues remain unresolved
- **Misaligned Priorities**: Gravitating toward features not aligned with business goals
- **Risk Blindness**: Overlooking potential downsides and abandoning risk management principles

When these scenarios occur, it's time to step back, reevaluate priorities, and refocus on solutions that truly benefit the business.

## Avoiding the Trap

**Keep Business Goals in Focus**  
Remember the ultimate business objectives to avoid getting distracted by technologies that don't contribute to success.

**Gather Subject Matter Knowledge**  
Gain deep understanding of business needs and challenges to better evaluate whether solutions will be truly beneficial.

**Seek Customer Feedback**  
Ask clients what they value most to identify priorities and avoid spending resources on unnecessary features.

**Use Risk Management**  
Identify and evaluate potential risks to prioritize important features and avoid wasting time on less critical ones.

## Business Success First

A tech leader's primary objective is delivering business success. By focusing on measurable business value, leaders ensure each feature delivers results aligned with overarching objectives. This creates relationships built on trust and transparency while using time and resources efficiently.

Project managers need clear goals, understanding of measurable business value, and feature prioritization based on that value. This approach maintains focus on business success and minimizes attention to sizzle that doesn't deliver.
