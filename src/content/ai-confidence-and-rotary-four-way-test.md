# AI, Confidence, and the Rotary Four-Way Test

Last week, I had the opportunity to speak with my fellow Rotarians at the **Downtown Wichita Rotary Club** about artificial intelligence — not as a technical deep dive, but as a practical conversation about how AI is already affecting our work, our communities, and our responsibilities as leaders.

We started with a local example many in Wichita will remember: the Wichi-Toad controversy. While it centered on a piece of artwork, the real issue wasn't the image itself — it was authorship, transparency, and trust. That same tension shows up wherever AI is used. AI doesn't eliminate responsibility; it concentrates it.

From there, we focused on a few core ideas that help demystify modern AI:

- **AI is fundamentally about prediction, not understanding.**  
  Large Language Models don't "know" facts — they predict likely next words based on patterns learned from data.
- **AI is a confidence engine, not a truth engine.**  
  These systems are trained to sound helpful and fluent, even when they're wrong or uncertain.
- **Human judgment matters more, not less.**  
  Because AI outputs sound authoritative, people must stay actively engaged in verification and decision-making.
- **The real risk isn't AI replacing people — it's people deferring judgment.**  
  Used thoughtfully, AI can be a powerful productivity and decision-support tool; used blindly, it can amplify errors and bias.

What stood out most during the discussion was how naturally these ideas align with Rotary's Four-Way Test. Asking *Is it the truth? Is it fair? Will it build goodwill and better friendships? Will it be beneficial to all concerned?* turns out to be exactly the right framework for evaluating AI use — whether in business, education, healthcare, or community projects.

AI is not something happening *to* us. It's something we are actively shaping through the choices we make, the questions we ask, and the values we apply. Rotary clubs, grounded in ethical leadership and service, are uniquely positioned to help guide those conversations at the local level.

I'm grateful for the thoughtful questions and engagement. Conversations like this are how we ensure that powerful tools are used wisely — and for the benefit of all.
