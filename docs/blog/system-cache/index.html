The primary audience includes intermediate C# developers looking to enhance their understanding of object-oriented design principles and improve their software engineering skills.","rank":19,"composite_score":30.9},{"name":"InquirySpark","description":"Spark Your Inquiry, Ignite Insights.","summary":{"text":"InquirySpark is a .NET 10-based survey and inquiry management system designed for read-only data interaction, utilizing an MVC architecture with a focus on immutable SQLite databases and strict data access patterns.
