const t='# Enhancing HttpClient with Decorator Pattern\r\n\r\n## Understanding the Decorator Pattern\r\n\r\nThe Decorator Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to add responsibilities to objects without subclassing.\r\n\r\n## Applying the Decorator Pattern to HttpClient\r\n\r\nIn the context of ASP.NET, the HttpClient is a fundamental component for making HTTP requests. By applying the Decorator Pattern, developers can extend the functionality of HttpClient instances without modifying the existing codebase. This approach is especially beneficial for adding cross-cutting concerns such as logging, caching, or authentication.\r\n\r\n### Example Implementation\r\n\r\nHere is a simple example of how you might implement the Decorator Pattern with an HttpClient:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic interface IHttpClientDecorator\r\n{\r\n    Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class LoggingHttpClientDecorator : IHttpClientDecorator\r\n{\r\n    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;\r\n\r\n    public LoggingHttpClientDecorator(HttpClient httpClient)\r\n    {\r\n        _httpClient = httpClient;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public async Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request)\r\n    {\r\n        Console.WriteLine($"Sending request to {request.RequestUri}");\r\n        var response = await _httpClient.SendAsync(request);\r\n        Console.WriteLine($"Received response: {response.StatusCode}");\r\n        return response;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, `LoggingHttpClientDecorator` adds logging functionality to the `HttpClient` without altering its core functionality.\r\n\r\n## Benefits of Using the Decorator Pattern\r\n\r\n- **Flexibility**: Easily add or remove functionalities at runtime.\r\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each decorator class has a single responsibility, making the code easier to maintain.\r\n- **Open/Closed Principle**: The pattern allows for extending the behavior of objects without modifying existing code.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nBy leveraging the Decorator Pattern, developers can enhance the capabilities of HttpClient in a clean and maintainable way. This approach not only adheres to solid design principles but also provides a scalable solution for managing cross-cutting concerns in ASP.NET applications.\r\n\r\n## Further Reading\r\n\r\n- [Decorator Pattern on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern)\r\n- [ASP.NET Core Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/)\r\n\r\nFor more insights and advanced techniques, follow Mark Hazleton\'s work on ASP.NET solutions.\r\n';export{t as default};
