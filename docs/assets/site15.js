const e='# Building My First React Site Using Vite\n\n## Introduction\n\nCreating a React site can be a daunting task, especially for beginners. However, with the right tools and guidance, it becomes a manageable and rewarding experience. In this article, we will explore how to build and deploy a React site using Vite, a fast and modern build tool, and GitHub Pages for hosting. We will also address common issues such as CORS and provide solutions to overcome them.\n\n## Why Choose Vite?\n\nVite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It offers several advantages:\n\n- **Fast Development**: Vite uses native ES modules in the browser, providing instant server start and lightning-fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement).\n- **Optimized Build**: It uses Rollup for production builds, ensuring optimized and efficient output.\n- **Rich Features**: Vite supports TypeScript, JSX, CSS, and more out of the box.\n\n## Setting Up Your React Project\n\n### Step 1: Install Vite\n\nFirst, ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, run the following command to create a new Vite project:\n\n```bash\nnpm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react\n```\n\nThis command sets up a new React project using Vite.\n\n### Step 2: Navigate and Start the Development Server\n\nNavigate to your project directory and start the development server:\n\n```bash\ncd my-react-app\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nYou should see your React app running at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n## Deploying to GitHub Pages\n\n### Step 1: Configure Your Repository\n\nCreate a new repository on GitHub and push your local project to it:\n\n```bash\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m "Initial commit"\ngit branch -M main\ngit remote add origin <your-repo-url>\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\n### Step 2: Deploy with GitHub Actions\n\nCreate a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file in your project with the following content:\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy to GitHub Pages\n\non:\n    push:\n        branches:\n            - main\n\njobs:\n    build:\n        runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n        steps:\n            - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n            - uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n              with:\n                  node-version: "14"\n            - run: npm install\n            - run: npm run build\n            - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n              with:\n                  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n                  publish_dir: ./dist\n```\n\nThis workflow will automatically build and deploy your site to GitHub Pages whenever you push to the `main` branch.\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n### Handling CORS\n\nCross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) can be a common issue when deploying web applications. Here are some tips to handle CORS:\n\n- **Use Proxy**: Configure a proxy in your `vite.config.js` to handle API requests during development.\n- **Server Configuration**: Ensure your server is configured to allow CORS requests.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBuilding a React site using Vite and deploying it to GitHub Pages is a straightforward process that offers speed and efficiency. By following the steps outlined above, you can quickly get your site up and running while addressing common issues like CORS.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/)\n- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/)\n- [GitHub Pages Guide](https://pages.github.com/)\n\nStart building your React site today and enjoy the seamless experience that Vite provides!\n';export{e as default};
