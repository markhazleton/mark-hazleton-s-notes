const e='# Building My First React Site Using Vite\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nCreating a React site can be a daunting task, especially for beginners. However, with the right tools and guidance, it becomes a manageable and rewarding experience. In this article, we will explore how to build and deploy a React site using Vite, a fast and modern build tool, and GitHub Pages for hosting. We will also address common issues such as CORS and provide solutions to overcome them.\r\n\r\n## Why Choose Vite?\r\n\r\nVite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It offers several advantages:\r\n\r\n- **Fast Development**: Vite uses native ES modules in the browser, providing instant server start and lightning-fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement).\r\n- **Optimized Build**: It uses Rollup for production builds, ensuring optimized and efficient output.\r\n- **Rich Features**: Vite supports TypeScript, JSX, CSS, and more out of the box.\r\n\r\n## Setting Up Your React Project\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Install Vite\r\n\r\nFirst, ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, run the following command to create a new Vite project:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command sets up a new React project using Vite.\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Navigate and Start the Development Server\r\n\r\nNavigate to your project directory and start the development server:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd my-react-app\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm run dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should see your React app running at `http://localhost:3000`.\r\n\r\n## Deploying to GitHub Pages\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Configure Your Repository\r\n\r\nCreate a new repository on GitHub and push your local project to it:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit init\r\ngit add .\r\ngit commit -m "Initial commit"\r\ngit branch -M main\r\ngit remote add origin <your-repo-url>\r\ngit push -u origin main\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Deploy with GitHub Actions\r\n\r\nCreate a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file in your project with the following content:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nname: Deploy to GitHub Pages\r\n\r\non:\r\n    push:\r\n        branches:\r\n            - main\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n    build:\r\n        runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n        steps:\r\n            - uses: actions/checkout@v2\r\n            - uses: actions/setup-node@v2\r\n              with:\r\n                  node-version: "14"\r\n            - run: npm install\r\n            - run: npm run build\r\n            - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\r\n              with:\r\n                  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\r\n                  publish_dir: ./dist\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis workflow will automatically build and deploy your site to GitHub Pages whenever you push to the `main` branch.\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\r\n\r\n### Handling CORS\r\n\r\nCross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) can be a common issue when deploying web applications. Here are some tips to handle CORS:\r\n\r\n- **Use Proxy**: Configure a proxy in your `vite.config.js` to handle API requests during development.\r\n- **Server Configuration**: Ensure your server is configured to allow CORS requests.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nBuilding a React site using Vite and deploying it to GitHub Pages is a straightforward process that offers speed and efficiency. By following the steps outlined above, you can quickly get your site up and running while addressing common issues like CORS.\r\n\r\n## Additional Resources\r\n\r\n- [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/)\r\n- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/)\r\n- [GitHub Pages Guide](https://pages.github.com/)\r\n\r\nStart building your React site today and enjoy the seamless experience that Vite provides!\r\n';export{e as default};
