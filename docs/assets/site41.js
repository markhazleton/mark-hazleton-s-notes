const e='# Generate Wiki Documentation from Your Code Repository\n\n## Enhance Your Project\'s Transparency\n\nCreating detailed documentation is crucial for any code repository. It not only helps in maintaining the project but also aids new developers in understanding the codebase. This guide will walk you through the process of generating wiki documentation directly from your code repository.\n\n### Why Generate Wiki Documentation?\n\n- **Improved Collaboration:** Documentation allows team members to understand the project better and contribute more effectively.\n- **Easier Onboarding:** New developers can get up to speed quickly with comprehensive documentation.\n- **Project Transparency:** Clear documentation helps stakeholders understand project progress and functionality.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n#### 1. Set Up Your Environment\n\nBefore you begin, ensure that you have the necessary tools and permissions to access your code repository. You will need:\n\n- Access to the repository\n- A text editor or IDE\n- Basic knowledge of markdown or other documentation formats\n\n#### 2. Choose a Documentation Tool\n\nSelect a tool that integrates well with your repository. Some popular options include:\n\n- **Doxygen:** Ideal for C++ and Java projects\n- **Sphinx:** Great for Python projects\n- **JSDoc:** Perfect for JavaScript projects\n\n#### 3. Extract Code Comments\n\nLeverage comments within your code to generate initial documentation. This can often be automated using the tools mentioned above.\n\n```python\n# Example Python function\ndef add(a, b):\n    """Add two numbers and return the result."""\n    return a + b\n```\n\n#### 4. Generate the Documentation\n\nRun the documentation tool to generate the initial wiki pages. Ensure that the output is in a format compatible with your wiki platform.\n\n#### 5. Review and Enhance\n\nOnce the documentation is generated, review it for accuracy and completeness. Add additional context or diagrams where necessary to enhance understanding.\n\n#### 6. Publish to Your Wiki\n\nFinally, publish the documentation to your project\'s wiki. Ensure that it is accessible and easy to navigate for all team members.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- **Regular Updates:** Keep your documentation up-to-date with code changes.\n- **Consistent Style:** Use a consistent style and format throughout your documentation.\n- **Feedback Loop:** Encourage team members to provide feedback on the documentation.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGenerating wiki documentation from your code repository is a valuable practice that can significantly improve project management and team collaboration. By following these steps, you can create comprehensive and useful documentation that benefits everyone involved in the project.\n';export{e as default};
