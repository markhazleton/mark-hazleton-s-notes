const n='# Syntax Highlighting with Prism.js for XML, PUG, YAML, and C#\n\n## Enhance Your Code Presentation\n\nSyntax highlighting is a crucial aspect of code readability and presentation. In this guide, we will explore how to implement syntax highlighting for XML, PUG, YAML, and C# using the powerful Prism.js library. Additionally, we will delve into automating the bundling process with `render-scripts.js` to streamline your workflow.\n\n## Why Use Prism.js?\n\nPrism.js is a lightweight, extensible syntax highlighter that supports a wide range of languages. It is easy to integrate and customize, making it an ideal choice for developers looking to enhance their code display on web pages.\n\n### Key Features of Prism.js:\n\n- **Lightweight and Fast**: Minimal impact on page load times.\n- **Extensible**: Easily add support for new languages.\n- **Customizable**: Tailor the appearance to fit your website\'s theme.\n\n## Implementing Syntax Highlighting\n\n### Step 1: Include Prism.js\n\nTo start using Prism.js, include the library in your HTML file. You can either download it from the [Prism.js website](https://prismjs.com) or use a CDN.\n\n```html\n<link href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.23.0/themes/prism.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />\n<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.23.0/prism.min.js"><\/script>\n```\n\n### Step 2: Add Language Support\n\nPrism.js supports many languages out of the box. For XML, PUG, YAML, and C#, ensure you include the relevant components.\n\n```html\n<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.23.0/components/prism-xml.min.js"><\/script>\n<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.23.0/components/prism-pug.min.js"><\/script>\n<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.23.0/components/prism-yaml.min.js"><\/script>\n<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.23.0/components/prism-csharp.min.js"><\/script>\n```\n\n### Step 3: Markup Your Code\n\nWrap your code blocks with `<pre>` and `<code>` tags, specifying the language class.\n\n```html\n<pre><code class="language-xml">\n<note>\n  <to>Tove</to>\n  <from>Jani</from>\n  <heading>Reminder</heading>\n  <body>Don\'t forget me this weekend!</body>\n</note>\n</code></pre>\n```\n\n## Automating with render-scripts.js\n\nTo automate the process of bundling and managing your scripts, consider using `render-scripts.js`. This tool helps streamline the inclusion of necessary scripts, reducing manual errors.\n\n### How to Use render-scripts.js\n\n1. **Install the Tool**: Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:\n\n    ```bash\n    npm install render-scripts\n    ```\n\n2. **Configure Your Scripts**: Create a configuration file to specify which scripts to bundle.\n\n3. **Run the Bundler**: Execute the bundler to automatically include and manage your scripts.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy leveraging Prism.js and `render-scripts.js`, you can significantly enhance the readability and management of your code snippets. This approach not only improves the visual appeal of your code but also streamlines your development process.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- [Prism.js Documentation](https://prismjs.com)\n- [render-scripts.js GitHub](https://github.com/your-repo/render-scripts)\n';export{n as default};
