const e="# Understanding Neural Networks\n\n## A Beginner's Guide to Neural Networks\n\nNeural networks are a cornerstone of modern artificial intelligence, mimicking the way human brains operate to process information. This guide aims to introduce the basic concepts of neural networks, their architecture, and their applications.\n\n### What are Neural Networks?\n\nNeural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected groups of nodes, or neurons, that work together to solve complex problems. These networks can learn from data, making them powerful tools for tasks such as image recognition, language processing, and more.\n\n### Key Components of Neural Networks\n\n1. **Neurons**: The basic units of a neural network, similar to the nerve cells in a human brain.\n2. **Layers**: Neural networks are composed of multiple layers:\n    - **Input Layer**: Receives the initial data.\n    - **Hidden Layers**: Perform computations and extract features.\n    - **Output Layer**: Produces the final result or prediction.\n3. **Weights and Biases**: Parameters that are adjusted during training to minimize error.\n4. **Activation Functions**: Determine the output of a neuron, introducing non-linearity into the model.\n\n### How Neural Networks Learn\n\nNeural networks learn through a process called training, which involves adjusting weights and biases based on the error of the output compared to the expected result. This is typically done using a technique called backpropagation.\n\n### Applications of Neural Networks\n\nNeural networks have a wide range of applications, including:\n\n- **Image and Speech Recognition**: Identifying objects in images or transcribing spoken words.\n- **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding and generating human language.\n- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Enabling cars to navigate and make decisions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNeural networks are a fundamental component of AI, enabling machines to learn and make decisions. As technology advances, their applications continue to expand, offering new possibilities in various fields.\n\nFor more detailed exploration, consider diving into specific types of neural networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).\n";export{e as default};
