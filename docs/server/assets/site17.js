const e="# Building Resilient .NET Applications with Polly\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nIn today's fast-paced digital world, ensuring that your applications are resilient and can handle unexpected failures is crucial. This article explores how you can leverage Polly, a .NET library, in conjunction with HttpClient to build robust applications that can gracefully handle retries, timeouts, and transient faults.\r\n\r\n## What is Polly?\r\n\r\nPolly is a .NET library that provides resilience and transient-fault handling capabilities. It allows developers to define policies such as retry, circuit breaker, timeout, bulkhead isolation, and fallback to manage the reliability of their applications.\r\n\r\n## Why Use Polly with HttpClient?\r\n\r\nHttpClient is a powerful tool for making HTTP requests in .NET applications. However, network communication is inherently unreliable, and applications need to handle potential failures gracefully. By integrating Polly with HttpClient, you can:\r\n\r\n- **Retry failed requests**: Automatically retry requests that fail due to transient faults.\r\n- **Implement timeouts**: Ensure that requests do not hang indefinitely by setting appropriate timeouts.\r\n- **Handle circuit breaking**: Prevent your application from repeatedly trying operations that are likely to fail.\r\n\r\n## Setting Up Polly with HttpClient\r\n\r\nTo get started with Polly, you need to install the Polly NuGet package. You can do this via the Package Manager Console:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nInstall-Package Polly\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce installed, you can define your resilience policies. Here’s a simple example of using Polly to retry a failed HTTP request:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar retryPolicy = Policy\r\n    .Handle<HttpRequestException>()\r\n    .WaitAndRetryAsync(3, retryAttempt => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(2, retryAttempt)));\r\n\r\nvar httpClient = new HttpClient();\r\n\r\nawait retryPolicy.ExecuteAsync(async () =>\r\n{\r\n    var response = await httpClient.GetAsync(\"https://api.example.com/data\");\r\n    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Implementing Advanced Policies\r\n\r\n### Circuit Breaker\r\n\r\nA circuit breaker policy prevents an application from performing an operation that is likely to fail. Here’s how you can implement it:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar circuitBreakerPolicy = Policy\r\n    .Handle<HttpRequestException>()\r\n    .CircuitBreakerAsync(2, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Timeout\r\n\r\nTimeout policies ensure that operations do not run indefinitely:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar timeoutPolicy = Policy\r\n    .TimeoutAsync<HttpResponseMessage>(10); // 10 seconds timeout\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nBy using Polly with HttpClient, you can significantly improve the resilience of your .NET applications. Whether you are handling retries, implementing timeouts, or managing circuit breakers, Polly provides a flexible and powerful way to enhance your application's reliability.\r\n\r\n## Further Reading\r\n\r\n- [Polly Documentation](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly)\r\n- [HttpClient Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/networking/http/httpclient)\r\n\r\n---\r\n";export{e as default};
