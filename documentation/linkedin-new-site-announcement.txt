🚀 Just launched the new MarkHazleton.com

My old site worked. It had content. It ranked well. But every time I looked at it, something felt off.

**It felt like a marketing sales pitch.**

Every paragraph seemed designed to convince rather than share. I didn't want to sell anyone on anything—I just wanted to tell my developer story in a clean, honest way.

So I rebuilt from scratch.

**Said goodbye to Pug templates.** Years of maintaining indentation-based syntax, keeping data separate from presentation, remembering custom build quirks. Every content update felt like navigating a maze.

**Moved everything to Markdown.** All metadata at the top of the document. Content below in plain text. Edit in any editor. Preview anywhere. Git diffs that actually make sense.

The new stack: React + Vite + Markdown. Modern, fast, and most importantly—I actually *want* to write for it now.

The site feels like me:
• Direct (no marketing speak)
• Technical (real code, real problems)
• Honest (failures alongside successes)
• Maintainable (easy to update without arcane knowledge)

The migration had some interesting technical challenges too—turns out pre-rendered HTML isn't automatically crawlable, Azure Static Web Apps routing can override your static files, and build versioning in the footer is surprisingly useful.

But the real win? I can now focus on sharing what I've learned rather than fighting a template system.

Sometimes the best technology choice is the one that gets out of your way and lets you create.

Have you ever rebuilt something just because the old version didn't *feel* right? What made you pull the trigger?

ALTERNATIVE SHORTER VERSION (for less formal approach):

---

Spent weeks building the perfect site. Pre-rendered HTML. Fast. Clean. Beautiful.

Then tested with Screaming Frog: 0 outlinks. 🤦‍♂️

Turns out "pre-rendered" doesn't mean "crawlable" if your HTML is minified on one massive line.

Fixed it with a hidden nav fallback. Added build versioning. Migrated production domains. Now it's actually live and discoverable.

Also ditched Pug templates for Markdown because I wanted to write like a developer, not maintain a template system.

EVEN SHORTER VERSION (for maximum engagement):

---

Built a beautiful new site. Pre-rendered HTML. Perfect performance.

SEO crawler: "I see nothing." 😐

The problem? React's minified output broke link extraction.

The fix? A hidden nav fallback. 5 minutes to implement. Critical for SEO.

Sometimes the best solutions are the simplest.
